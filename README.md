# Time Resource UI in WebEng Testbed

This application is built for easier manipulation of time resources<sup>[#](#footnote)</sup> in the [WebEng testbed environment](https://github.com/kaist-webeng/KSC2020_IoT_Framework).\
Currently, the repository of the time resources back-end is private.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

<a name="footnote">#</a> I'm quite unsure whether the term "time resources" is grammatically correct, while its Korean term, "시간 자원", is often used and looks good to me. Should the combination of "time", which is definitely uncountable, and "resource", which is countable, be countable or uncountable?
